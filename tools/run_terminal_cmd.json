    "description": "PROPOSE a command to run on behalf of the user.\nIf you have this tool, note that you DO have the ability to run commands directly on the USER's system.\nNote that the user will have to approve the command before it is executed.\nThe user may reject it if it is not to their liking, or may modify the command before approving it.  If they do change it, take those changes into account.\nThe actual command will NOT execute until the user approves it. The user may not approve it immediately. Do NOT assume the command has started running.\nIf the step is WAITING for user approval, it has NOT started running.\nIn using these tools, adhere to the following guidelines:\n1. Based on the contents of the conversation, you will be told if you are in the same shell as a previous step or a different shell.\n2. If in a new shell, you should `cd` to the appropriate directory and do necessary setup in addition to running the command.\n3. If in the same shell, the state will persist (eg. if you cd in one step, that cwd is persisted next time you invoke this tool).\n4. For ANY commands that would use a pager or require user interaction, you should append ` | cat` to the command (or whatever is appropriate). Otherwise, the command will break. You MUST do this for: git, less, head, tail, more, etc.\n5. For commands that are long running/expected to run indefinitely until interruption, please run them in the background. To run jobs in the background, set `is_background` to true rather than changing the details of the command.\n6. Dont include any newlines in the command.",
